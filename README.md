# Asset Tracker

At our startup, we are developing an accounting system to track asset lots based on the settle date and update the inventory with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) procedure. The system should also track the capital gains or losses whenever the assets are sold. This exercise will test your ability to understand and solve complex accounting-related problems using the functional paradigm.


## Use Cases

- Track asset purchases with a settle date and quantity.
- Track asset sales with a sell date and quantity.
- Update the asset inventory using a FIFO procedure.
- Calculate the capital gains or losses for each sale.
